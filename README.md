This is part of the Advance Forms Project in The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker

No live preview for this project available since I don't have unlimited apps to upload at fly.io.

This app can be installed locally if you have rails and git installed on your machine by following these steps:

1. Clone repo: `git clone git@github.com:lbackman/flight-booker.git`.
2. Navigate into the directory: `cd flight-booker`.
3. Install the required gems: `bundle install`.
4. Migrate the database: `rails db:migrate`.
5. Seed the database with flights: `rails db:seed`.
6. Start up a local server: `rails server`.
7. Go to your browser of choice and type `localhost:3000` in the address bar.
